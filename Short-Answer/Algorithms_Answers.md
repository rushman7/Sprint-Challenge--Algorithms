#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Logarithmic O(log n), at all times there is one operation performed for each iteration while a < n^3


b) Linearithmic O(n log n), the loop is justified as n while the while loop within each iteration is an extra step which results in log n.


c) O(n log(n), Since we divide, then conquer

## Exercise II
